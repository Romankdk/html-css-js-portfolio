            <h1>Features of the Shopping Website & Mobile App</h1>
            <p>Welcome to our Shopping Website and Mobile App, designed to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable online shopping experience. Below, we outline the key features that make our platform user-friendly and efficient.</p>
            
            <h2>User Account Management</h2>
            <p>Our application allows users to create accounts easily by providing a username and password. This feature is essential as it enables users to log in to their accounts, granting them access to personalized features tailored to their preferences. Once logged in, users can view their account details, including their store credit, which enhances their shopping experience by allowing them to keep track of their available funds.</p>
            
            <h2>Product Catalog</h2>
            <p>The application showcases a comprehensive catalog of electronic products, allowing users to browse through a wide variety of items. Each product is clearly listed with its name and price, making it easy for users to find exactly what they are looking for. The catalog is designed to be intuitive, ensuring that users can navigate through different categories and discover new products effortlessly.</p>
            
            <h2>Shopping Cart Functionality</h2>
            <p>One of the standout features of our platform is the shopping cart functionality. Users can add products to their shopping cart for later purchase, which is particularly useful for those who wish to compare items before making a decision. The cart displays the selected items along with their total price, helping users keep track of their purchases and budget effectively. This feature ensures a smooth transition from browsing to buying.</p>
            
            <h2>User-Friendly Navigation</h2>
            <p>The application is equipped with a simple and intuitive menu system that guides users through various options, such as logging in, creating an account, viewing the product catalog, and managing their cart. The menu adapts based on whether the user is logged in or not, providing relevant options for each state. This adaptability enhances the user experience by ensuring that users can easily find the features they need without unnecessary confusion.</p>
            
            <h2>Feedback Mechanism</h2>
            <p>Engagement is key to improving our platform, which is why we have implemented a feedback mechanism. Users can express their opinions about products using "Like" and "Dislike" buttons. This feature not only allows users to share their thoughts but also helps us gather valuable insights into customer preferences and product performance, enabling continuous improvement of our offerings.</p>
            
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>When the application starts, users are presented with a main menu where they can choose to log in, create an account, or view the product catalog. If a user opts to log in, they enter their credentials, and upon successful login, they gain access to their account and shopping cart. Users can browse the product catalog, add items to their cart, and view their cart at any time . The application is designed to run continuously in a loop, allowing users to navigate through the menus until they choose to exit, ensuring a user-friendly experience from start to finish.</p>
